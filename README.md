Face detection is a core technique that finds extensive use in many areas of computer vision. The technology finds relevance in a wide array of use cases like facial recognition, emotion analysis, identity verification, video surveillance and human-computer interaction. State-of-the-art deep learning methods have led to the development of face detection systems that are able to overcome challenges such as occlusion, varying image quality or human faces covered by masks with high accuracy.
This project involves designing a deep learning system that can effectively detect faces and analyze the associated emotions of individuals, regardless of whether or not they're wearing masks. it's built using Python programming language along with popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV and Streamlit.
Both face detection and emotion classification are essential features of this project because they serve applications in fields such as mental health monitoring, customer analysis, and intelligent tutoring systems. The model is trained using data sets of masked faces divided into seven different categories. Angry, happy, fear, sad, neutral, disgusted and surprised. we've created a custom CNN in Keras and fine-tuned it to obtain excellent performance on both facial emotion datasets with or without masks.
Designing and training the model makes use of cnn_emotion_model.py while evaluation is performed in evaluate_model.py. Automated data preprocessing steps, such as masking and organization of the dataset, are implemented in main.py. Streamlit-based interface in streamlit_demo.py enables users to easily access and use the model with either their webcam or by uploading images.
The project emerged from the growing demand for face-aware systems in a world where wearing masks is prevalent following the pandemic. Most conventional face recognition or detection algorithms are challenged by masked faces, which calls for models trained explicitly on that type of data. This project directly overcomes that difficulty by incorporating simultaneous mask detection and masked emotion recognition into a unified system.
Thanks to its modular design, the entire system can be easily extended with functionality such as facial landmark detection, gender recognition and attention monitoring. This project provides a solid core for developing advanced face analytics systems.
The project effectively showcases how deep learning can be used effectively for face detection as well as how Python and open-source tools make it possible to develop robust, easy-to-use, and intelligent solutions. The rest of this report will explore the issue context, model design, training approach, performance assessment, extra features and lessons learned throughout the development process.
